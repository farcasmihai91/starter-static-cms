# `vars` specifies variables which may be used as ${VAR_NAME} in devspace.yaml
vars:
- name: STRAPI_IMAGE
  value: starter/static-cms
- name: CLIENT_IMAGE

# `deployments` tells DevSpace how to deploy this project
deployments:
- name: starter-static-cms
  # This deployment uses `kubectl` but you can also define `helm` deployments

# `profiles` lets you modify the config above for different environments (e.g. dev vs production)
profiles:
  # This profile is called `production` and you can use it for example using: devspace deploy -p production
  # We generally recommend using the base config without any profiles as optimized for development (e.g. image build+push is disabled)
- name: production
# This profile adds our image to the config so that DevSpace will build, tag and push our image before the deployment
